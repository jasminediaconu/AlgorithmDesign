# Feedback Dijkstra assignment

Legend:
 - (~) Point for improvement
 - (=) Neutral comment
 - (+) Well done!

## Exercise 1

- (+) Your pseudocode is easy to read and you properly introduce the notation you are going to use.
- (+) Good job on also including a small piece of text in just "natural language" to explain your pseudocode! This always helps the readers a great deal!
- (~) This is the solution to the wrong problem.

## Exercise 2

- (+) You explain all of the major parts of the algorithm well and deduce the correct run time complexity.

## Exercise 3

- (+) This is indeed a good suggestion to increase the run time.

## Exercise 4

- (~) This is not supposed to be a functional correctness testset, but isntead should test the time complexity of the algorithm! For this we need very large testcases!
- (~) I would have liked to see more variety in the sizes of the graphs. What happens when `m << n`, what happens when the graph is fully connected, i.e. `m=n^2`?
- (~) In general I would recommend increasing the size of the graphs so that runtime becomes several minutes, this allows for more accurate comparisons.
- (~) I would recommend you create several instances of graphs of the same size. What if the instance you have created has a one-step solution? Then the difference between the algorithms becomes trivially small. By creating multiple graphs more extensive analysis can be done :)

## Exercise 5

- (+) You have been able to measure differences in run time.
- (~) A discussion of your results seems to be missing. Do these results match your expectations? Why (not)?

## General remarks

- (=) Well done on handing in the assignment! You have done a first(?) experimental analysis of algorithms. I hope this feedback has given you some ideas on how to further improve on your experimental analyses in the future :) If you have any questions, feel free to tackle a TA during on of the lab sessions!
