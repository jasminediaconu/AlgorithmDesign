/**
 *
 * In these uncertain times you have taken to playing online boardgames with your
 * friends and family. After playing for a few weeks however, the group of people
 * interested in joining your Friday Games sessions has grown quite large.
 * The group is so large, that the speed and fun of the game is suffering.
 * It turns out that this speed is determined by the player who has the poorest network
 * connection. Obviously, you need to split up to play the games in smaller groups.
 * You decide to do this using a peer-to-peer implementation instead of relying on the
 * server.
 *
 * The quality of a game using the peer-to-peer clients depends on the network delay
 * (ping time) between the players in the game as follows: the highest quality is obtained
 * if all clients are (indirectly) connected to each other while minimising the sum of
 * the network delays of the used connections. To make matters worse for your planning,
 * some people have already decided that no matter what, they want to be directly connected.
 *
 * You have access to n premium accounts for the website and so want to create a total of
 * n groups. You are given the group of kâ‰¥n people, the ping times between them,
 * and the connections that you have to use as these players want to be in the same group
 * no matter what. Implement the function lanParty that given this information computes
 * the (minimum) sum of the ping times of the extra connections you need to make to create
 * n connected groups.
